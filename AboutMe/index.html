    <p>Let me introduce myself. This coming November My wife and I will have been married for 40 years.
        We have 4 children, Three living here with us and one with Heavenly Father.
        I decided to return to learning at the ripe old age of 60. EEK....
    </p>
    <p>I have taken many programming languages in the past: Basic, Fortran, Cobal, BasicA, C++, And python.
        Most of these languages are not used in coding anymore.
        I am really excited to start working with web pages. 
    </p>
    <p>I work for the United States Postal Service as a Rural Route Carrier. 
       I have been doing this for about 5 years and absolutely love it.
       Before that I worked in the retail industry for 24 years in management and upper management.
       I don't miss the rat race of retail at all.
